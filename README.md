### Overview
In this repository, we will learn step by step guide to create **Heart disease prediction** using Machine Learning by using Logistic Regression Algorithm and deploy it on Heroku with Flask

### Motivation
Heart disease is one of the biggest challenge globally in the healthcare industry. Cardiac arrest causes due to various factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, genetics, age, smoking, stress, family history etc. We can increase the survival rate of a person, through early detection, better treatment during the right time. Considering various factors with available data we can predict chance of heart attack with the help of Machine Learning Algorithm.
